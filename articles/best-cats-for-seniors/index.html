                <div class="bg-slate-100 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
                    <ul class="mb-0">
                        <li><strong>Calm temperament</strong> – Cats that enjoy peaceful environments and don't have excess energy</li>
                        <li><strong>Low to moderate activity</strong> – No need for intense play sessions multiple times a day</li>
                        <li><strong>Affectionate but not demanding</strong> – Enjoys companionship without constant attention-seeking</li>
                        <li><strong>Quiet voice</strong> – Minimal meowing and vocalizing</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy grooming</strong> – Short coats or non-matting fur (unless you enjoy brushing!)</li>
                        <li><strong>Good health</strong> – Fewer breed-specific issues means lower vet costs</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>🐾 Kitten vs. Adult Cat</h2>

                <p>While kittens are adorable, <strong>adult cats (3-8 years) are often better for seniors</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Established personality</strong> – You know exactly what you're getting</li>
                    <li><strong>Less supervision needed</strong> – No kitten-proofing or constant monitoring</li>
                    <li><strong>Calmer energy</strong> – Past the crazy kitten phase</li>
                    <li><strong>Already trained</strong> – Litter box habits are established</li>
                    <li><strong>Senior cats (8+)</strong> – Often overlooked in shelters, they make wonderful, mellow companions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>⚠️ Breeds That May Be Too Demanding</h2>

                <p>Some breeds have high energy or attention needs that might be overwhelming:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bengal</strong> – Extremely active, needs lots of stimulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Abyssinian</strong> – High energy, constantly on the move</li>
                    <li><strong>Siamese</strong> – Very vocal, demands attention</li>
                    <li><strong>Savannah</strong> – Wild hybrid, needs experienced owner</li>
                    <li><strong>Oriental</strong> – Talkative and demanding</li>
                </ul>

                    <ul class="mb-0">

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-0">Which cat breeds require the least maintenance?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">British Shorthair, American Shorthair, and Russian Blue are among the lowest-maintenance breeds. They have short coats that need minimal grooming, are generally healthy, and don't demand constant attention. Exotic Shorthairs offer Persian-like calm with easier coat care.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-0">Should seniors adopt a kitten or an adult cat?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">Adult cats (3-7 years) are often ideal for seniors. Their personalities are established, they're calmer than kittens, and they require less supervision. Senior cats (8+ years) can also be wonderful—they're mellow and grateful for a loving home.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 mt-0">How much does it cost to care for a cat per month?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">Basic monthly cat care costs $50-100 for food, litter, and routine supplies. Budget an additional $200-400 annually for vet checkups and vaccinations. Pet insurance costs $15-40/month. Low-maintenance breeds with fewer health issues tend to have lower overall costs.</p>
