                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 mb-2">What makes a cat breed low maintenance?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">Low maintenance cats typically have short coats that need minimal grooming, are independent enough to handle alone time, adapt well to different environments, and have calm temperaments. They don't require excessive exercise or constant attention.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-5">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 mb-2">Do low maintenance cats still need attention?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">Yes! Low maintenance doesn't mean no maintenance. All cats need daily feeding, fresh water, clean litter boxes, and some playtime. These breeds simply require less grooming and are more adaptable than high-maintenance breeds.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-5">
                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 mb-2">Are short-haired cats always low maintenance?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">Not necessarily. While short coats require less grooming, some short-haired breeds like Siamese or Bengal are high-energy and very vocal, requiring significant attention. True low maintenance cats combine easy grooming with calm, independent personalities.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-0 mb-2">What's the best low maintenance cat for first-time owners?</h3>
                        <p class="mb-0">The American Shorthair and British Shorthair are excellent choices for first-time owners. They're healthy, easygoing, independent, and require minimal grooming. Both breeds adapt well to various living situations.</p>
