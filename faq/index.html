Key factors include activity level (do you want a playful or calm cat?), grooming needs, and whether you have children or other pets. Apartment dwellers should look for quieter, calmer breeds. Take our breed quiz to get personalized recommendations based on your situation."

These breeds have lower energy levels, rarely vocalize loudly, and are content in smaller spaces. Avoid high-energy breeds like Bengals or vocal breeds like Siamese if you're in an apartment."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "No cat is 100% hypoallergenic—all cats produce the Fel d 1 protein that causes allergies. However, some breeds produce less of this protein or shed less, making them easier for allergy sufferers. Siberian, Balinese, Russian Blue, Bengal, and Sphynx are often recommended. Spending time with a breed before adopting is the best way to test your reaction."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Look for patient, playful breeds that tolerate handling. Ragdoll, Maine Coon, Birman, Abyssinian, and Burmese are excellent family cats. They're social, enjoy play, and are typically good with kids. Avoid shy or easily stressed breeds. Always teach children to handle cats gently and respect their boundaries."

These breeds actively seek human companionship and often follow their owners around the house."

            "text": "Low-maintenance breeds include British Shorthair, American Shorthair, Russian Blue, and Chartreux. These cats are independent, have short coats requiring minimal grooming, and are generally healthy. They're content entertaining themselves and don't demand constant attention, making them ideal for busy owners."

Lifespan varies by breed—Siamese and Burmese often live 15-20+ years, while some larger breeds like Maine Coons average 10-13 years. Factors affecting lifespan include diet, exercise, veterinary care, and whether the cat lives indoors or outdoors."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Low-shedding breeds include Sphynx (hairless), Cornish Rex and Devon Rex (short curly coats), Siamese, Bengal, and Russian Blue. The Siberian, despite having long fur, produces less of the Fel d 1 allergen. Regular brushing helps with all breeds, and short-haired cats generally shed less than long-haired varieties."

If you want a quiet home or live in an apartment with noise restrictions, avoid Siamese, Oriental, and Burmese—they're known for being very talkative."

            "text": "Both have advantages. Kittens are playful, adaptable, and you can shape their socialization—but they require more time, training, and supervision. Adult cats have established personalities (what you see is what you get), are typically calmer, and are often already litter trained. Seniors make wonderful companions and are often overlooked in shelters."

Success depends on both animals' personalities and proper introduction. Cats raised with dogs from a young age typically adapt best. Always supervise initial interactions and provide the cat with escape routes and high perches."

Mixed-breed cats (domestic shorthair/longhair) are unique individuals with varied traits, often healthier due to genetic diversity, and readily available at shelters. Both make wonderful pets."
